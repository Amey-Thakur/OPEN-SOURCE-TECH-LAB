                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Open Source Tech Lab (CSL405) is a core laboratory subject in the Second Year (Semester IV) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. This course introduces students to the philosophy of open-source software and provides hands-on experience with Python as a primary tool for developing robust, scalable, and efficient applications.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in open-source development:

- **Python Fundamentals**: Datatypes, operators, control flow, and data structures (List, Tuple, Set, Dict).
- **Functional Programming**: Functions, lambda expressions, map, filter, and reduce operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, constructors, and inheritance patterns.
- **File Handling**: Reading, writing, and appending data with robust error management.
- **GUI Development**: Creating interactive desktop applications using Tkinter and ttk widgets.
- **Database Connectivity**: Integrating Python with MySQL for CRUD operations.
- **Open Source Methodology**: Understanding licensing, collaborative development, and version control.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, assignments, and practical implementations compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As the industry shifts towards open-source ecosystems, mastering Python and its integration with databases and GUIs remains a critical skill set. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for reviewing methodologies and strengthening my understanding of systems-level integration.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive practical work beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of Python and OSTL fundamentals.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Open Source Tech Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **COVID-19 Impact**: This coursework was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Due to the nationwide lockdown and the sudden transition to online learning, several planned laboratory sessions and collaborative note-taking activities could not be carried out as originally intended. Despite these challenges, efforts were made to adapt and preserve as much work as possible.

> [!TIP]
> **Pythonic Thinking**: Always start by understanding the problem, then write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names. Use list comprehensions, generators, and built-in functions to write efficient Python. Practice the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and leverage Python's extensive standard library for common tasks.
